# Tips
This is my first IOS app for calculating tips for the billed amount based on the user input.

Calculating tip based on the user input in the bill amount field. 


Work in progress items :

The below portions are incomplete since i ran into issues and trying figure out how to resolve them.

When the user clicks on the bill amount text area, the decimal pad is not popping up. Per the video walkthrough, i should enable
the keyboard settings under the hardware menu, but i dont find in that in my xcode workspace.

Calculate the tips based on the percentages on the segmented control. When i try to connect the segmented control field to the class, the 
variable is getting declared with the type UIView.
